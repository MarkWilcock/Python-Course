# Intermediate Challenges

## Write a function

Write a function to add two numbers - and invoke it

Modify the function so that the expected argument is a tuple of two numbers

Create a list of such tuples e.g. coords = [ (3,4), (12, 13), ...]

Iterate through the list to generate a list of distances from the origin (use Pythagoras)

1. use a for loop
1. use a list comprehension
1. (advanced) use map() and a lambda function

## Chat with an AI model

Get a free [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or Google [Gemini Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).  You may need to sign up.

Run the quickstart example to chat with the model.

Modify the quickstart so ask the model one of the Python questions in this exercise

## Use the very popular VSCode editor with GitHub Codespaces

Set up a GitHub Codespaces session.  This uses the VSCode editor.

Copy over some code from your Colab notebooks and run these in VSCode

Compare and contrast the two editors.  Which do you prefer?

## .py vs .ipynb

1. What is the difference between .py and .ipynb files?
1. Show how to run code in each type

## Explore some famous packages

Python has many famous packages.  Explore some of these.

For each package, wite a tiny script that shows its capabilities.

## Python Environments

Explain - What is a Python environment? Why are they used?  What is pip?

Show the packages listed in your environment

Install a packages not already in your environment, then test that it is has been installed, imported and is working properly?

## Explore Hugging Face

Hugging Face is The GitHub for AI models. Go to the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/) and explore the models, spaces, tasks and datasets.

Look at the model of some models in particular

* Microsoft Phi-4 [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4)
* a small Deepseek  model [here](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B)

Click on the "Use this model" button to see the Python code.  Copy this and use to get a basic result.

Give a overview demo to the class.
