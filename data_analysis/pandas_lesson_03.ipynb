    "**Grouping** is the process of splitting data into groups based on some criteria (e.g., grouping sales data by region).\n",

    "# Basic grouping and aggregation\n",
    "df.groupby('column').sum()\n",
    "df.groupby('column')['specific_col'].mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple aggregations\n",

    "# Different aggregations per column\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use What\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`.agg()`**: When you need summary statistics per group\n",
    "- **`.transform()`**: When you need to add group statistics back to each row\n",
    "- **`.filter()`**: When you need to keep/remove entire groups based on conditions\n",
    "- **`.apply()`**: When you need maximum flexibility (can return aggregated or transformed data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sales Analysis**: Group by region/product to calculate total sales, average order value\n",
    "2. **Time Series**: Group by date/month to find trends, seasonality\n",
    "3. **Customer Segmentation**: Group by customer type to analyze behavior patterns\n",
